<h1>COVID-19 Data Analysis and Tracker</h1>
Beginning in around 2019 November was the COVID-19 pandemic. Lots of global data regarding the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations have 
been recorded. With so much data available, I decided to create a personalized COVID-19 dashboard that displayed the data I am most interested 
in tracking.
<br><br>
I obtained my data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">ourworldindata.org</a> and used Microsoft SQL to explore the 
data set. Thereafter, I selected a few queries I wanted to visualize, then utilized Tableau to create my dashboard.
