<h1>COVID-19 Data Analysis and Tracker</h1>
<p>Beginning in around 2019 November was the COVID-19 pandemic. Lots of global data regarding the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations have been recorded.
With so much data avaliable, I decided to create a personalized COVID-19 dashboard that diplayed data I am most interested in tracking. I obtained my data from
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">ourworldindata.org</a> and used Microsoft SQL to explore the data set. Thereafter, I selected a few queries I
wanted to visualize, then ultilized Tableau to create my dashbaord.</p>
